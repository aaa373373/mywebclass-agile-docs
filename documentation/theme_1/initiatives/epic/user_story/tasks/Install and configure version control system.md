#Task Title: Install and configure version control system
User Story: As a software developer, I want to collaborate more effectively with my team by using a version control system so that we can manage changes and work on code together without conflicts.
Description: Install and configure a suitable version control system on all team members' computers, such as Git or SVN. Ensure that all team members are able to use the system and understand its basic features, such as branching, merging, and committing changes. Test that team members can check out code, make changes, and push those changes back to the shared repository.
Effort Estimate: 8 hours
Assigned To: John, Software Developer
Priority: High
Status: In progress
Tests:
1.	Ensure all team members can access and use the version control system on their computers.
2.	Verify that code changes can be committed, merged, and pushed to the shared repository without conflicts.
Notes: Dependencies include ensuring that all team members have the necessary permissions and access to the shared repository, and that any necessary software or plugins are installed on their computers.
