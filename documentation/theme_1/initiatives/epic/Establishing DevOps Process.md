#Establishing DevOps Process
Description: This epic involves setting up a DevOps process to streamline software development and delivery, including selecting a suitable process, setting up version control, choosing a CI/CD tool, and implementing a testing and quality assurance process.
Goals:
•	Establish a robust and efficient DevOps process
•	Improve the speed and quality of software development and delivery
User Stories:
1.	As a software developer, I want to collaborate more effectively with my team by using a version control system so that we can manage changes and work on code together without conflicts.
2.	As a project manager, I want to implement a continuous integration and delivery pipeline using a suitable tool, so that we can automate testing, build and deploy software with confidence, and avoid human errors.
Dependencies:
•	Availability of suitable tools and resources for setting up the DevOps process
•	Coordination and communication among team members for successful implementation
Risks:
•	Resistance to change from team members due to lack of familiarity with DevOps processes
•	Potential errors during implementation and configuration of the tools
Estimated Effort: Approximately 6-8 weeks, including research and evaluation of suitable tools, configuration and testing of version control, CI/CD tool, and testing and quality assurance process, documentation, and training.
Business Value:
•	Improved efficiency and productivity in software development and delivery
•	Higher quality software with fewer bugs and issues
•	Reduced time-to-market and increased customer satisfaction
Priority: High - this epic is essential for establishing an efficient and effective software development process and should be prioritized accordingly
